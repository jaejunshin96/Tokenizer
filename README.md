# **EvalToken42: Development Stack & Design Choices**

## **Introduction**
EvalToken42 (`ET42`) is a decentralized peer evaluation system built on Ethereum.
This README explains the **development stack** used and the **choices made** during development.

---

## **🔹 Development Stack**

| **Technology**  | **Purpose** |
|---------------|------------|
| **Hardhat**  | Smart contract development, testing, and deployment. |
| **Solidity**  | Writing secure, efficient smart contracts. |
| **Etherscan**  | Verifying and interacting with the deployed contract. |
| **Sepolia Testnet**  | Simulating real-world blockchain transactions before mainnet deployment. |

## **🔹 Why These Choices?**

### **1️⃣ Hardhat (Smart Contract Framework)**
✅ **Advanced Debugging** – Built-in console logs (`console.log()` in Solidity).
✅ **Fast Testing & Deployment** – Runs local Ethereum nodes for quick execution.
✅ **Seamless Integration** – Works well with `ethers.js` for frontend interactions.
✅ **Plugin Support** – Includes Etherscan verification, gas reports, and more.

### **2️⃣ Solidity (Smart Contract Language)**
✅ **Industry Standard** – Used by Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and Layer-2 solutions.
✅ **Secure & Auditable** – Open-source libraries (OpenZeppelin) improve contract security.
✅ **Gas Optimization** – Supports optimizations for cost-effective transactions.

### **3️⃣ Etherscan (Blockchain Explorer & Contract Interaction)**
✅ **Contract Verification** – Allows users to audit and interact with the contract.
✅ **Transaction Tracking** – Helps debug and verify contract execution.
✅ **No-Code Interaction** – Users can call smart contract functions without writing code.

### **4️⃣ Sepolia Testnet (Ethereum Test Network)**
✅ **Safe Testing Environment** – Transactions don’t require real ETH.
✅ **Fast Block Confirmation** – Ensures efficient testing without mainnet delays.
✅ **Etherscan Support** – Easily verify and interact with contracts.
